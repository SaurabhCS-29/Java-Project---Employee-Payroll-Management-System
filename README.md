# Java-Project---Employee-Payroll-Management-System

The "Employee Payroll Management System" in Java, implemented using core Java and
object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, is a software solution that displays employee 
information, including their name, salary, and ID. This system leverages OOP principles 
to create a structured and efficient program for managing employee data, simplifying 
payroll processes, and enhancing overall organization and accessibility of employee 
records.
